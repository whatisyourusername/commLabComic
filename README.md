## Project Name:
The Monkey Apocalypse 

## Project Description:
   This project explores the theme of technology and human interference with nature. 'The Monkey Apocalypse' reveals a fictional story of an evil scientist that conducts failed experiments at Monkeys. Although the Monkeys are irrational as humans, they have developed an emotional relationship in the experimental lab. Desperation invades their feelings and actions. The monkeys are angry, although monkeys are irrational and weakened from daily trials. The goal of this comic is to create a comedy inspired by a monkey revolution.

We found the integration of decision-making in the first tab is crucial because it allows the user to understand the stance of choosing nature and human behaviors. Following the principle of interaction in books, the user is expected to move from one panel to another using a carousel. Moreover, users can choose early or following panels from dots found on the right. When the users run through their choice, they can refresh the website to experience the other narrative of the monkies and humans based on a sequencing change.

   This project is inspired by Elon Musk's recent monkey experiment, as demonstrated in CNN's article https://edition.cnn.com/2022/02/17/business/elon-musk-neuralink-animal-cruelty-intl-scli/index.html. As per the article, Elon Musk's lab experiment failed; thus, leading a monkey to die as a result of nuralink. The fiction of this project is inspired by the films I-Robot (2004) and War for the Planet of the Apes (2017). These films depict a revolution caused by the themes of ignorance and chaos led by humankind. In both films, nature seems prominent, and the solution is to end humans for the sake of this planet.
    
   Our comic aims to raise awareness about human behavior and its effects on nature. For instance, through an open conversation about nature vs. humans, the users could appeal to the issue of global warming. And so, the user will examine questions such as what are the ways that will save our planet before it is too late?

## Process:
   We created the illustrations for our project and then started working iteratively on the presentation of the drawings as a web comic. In our final site, we used a lot of libraries to implemnet different interactions and animations. The starting page enables the user to make one of two choices that will affect the order of the comic. A grab and drop interaction was implemented on this page using a library. The actual comic was implemented as a vertical photo carousel using a library. More libraries were used to animate the fading in and out, growing, and shrinking animations of elements on the page as the user progresses through the comic.
   
   'The Monkey Apocalypse' ran through multiple idea developments, and we aimed to work on ways of interactivity that resonate with our theme and message. https://github.com/SeifAmr/Comics-project shares our development phases. 'The Monkey Apocalypse' started as a classically styled comic with scroll motion revealing the storyline. Our next step was to involve interactivity to have suspense as an aspect of the story. Suspense as an element is essential because we thought it would strengthen the user's involvement in the comic. Lastly, the implementation of decision-making is a powerful tool because it connects the user to a world in which he is a spectator.

## Reflection & Evaluation:
   As a result, the project successfully displays two sceneries of human's perspective and monkey's perspective, flipping the order of the comic. This efficiently illustrates the cycle of "the revolution" of the humans and the monkeys. However, since the comic is 6 to 7 panels, the main stream of the story does seem to lack of flow. The revolution of monkeys' have only a single panel, and the humans' doesn't even have one. It would have been a much successful comic if there was more time to work on the content of the comic to increase the quality of the storytelling.
   
   Web interection-wise, the website's layout that allows the user to choose the monkey or the human at the beginning, which allows the user to choose the direction of the storyline, deciding which side of story the user wants to experience. Furthermore, the comic pages are very user-friendly, click bottom and top arrow to go to the next and the previous panel. These aspects of the website allows the website to become user-interative.
